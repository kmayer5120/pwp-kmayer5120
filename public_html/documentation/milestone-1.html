            <h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of my personal website project is to be a page that promotes my wife's crochet business.
                This will be a page that she can share to others such that she can promote her crochet work, crochet
                patterns
                for sale, and to be contacted by buyers and potential pattern testers. The site serve as a brochure of
                sorts
                and
                will link to her Etsy, social media, and a Google form for potential pattern testers to apply to.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience:</h3>
            <p>
                The audience of this site will be crochet enthusiasts. Because this will be for artsy people, it will
                need
                to
                be aesthetically pleasing. There is a wide demographic for this hobby and people interested in it so it
                will
                need to be user friendly and easy to navigate. It is important that it is eye-catching and professional
                looking
                so the visitor will take my wife's crochet work and business seriously.
            </p>

            <h3>Goal:</h3>
            <p>
                The main goal is to drive visitors of the website to my wife's various online stores so they will buy
                her
                crochet
                products or buy her custom crochet patterns. The secondary goal is to drive visitors to her social
                media.
                The
                tertiary
                goal is to serve as a gallery for her crochet projects which should generate further interest in her
                business.
                Beyond
                these goals, this website will serve to show that I am capable of making a functional website for a
                business.
