        The navbar under the header will serve two purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>Link to parts of the page and scroll to them.</li>
          <li>Link to external sites related to her business.</li>

        <h3>About Company Section</h3>
        <p>
          This about company section will have content introducing what my
          wife's crochet company does, sells, and any possible news. Because I'm
          making this for her real world use, I am having her write up a short
          description fill this section out. This should be relatively brief so
          as not to bore the user. There will also be some picture to catch the
          user's eye and direct there attention to this section. It will most
          likely either be another company logo or maybe another example of her
          work.

        <h3>Gallery Section</h3>
        <p>
          This gallery section will serve to showcase her most recent work and
          patterns that she has completed. If any of these images are something
          for sale on her Etsy or Ravelry, then they will be linked to
          accordingly.

          any sort of social links.

      <div class="content">
        <h3>Services Section</h3>
        <p>
          This section will talk about what services she offers: Custom crochet
          items, custom crochet patterns, etc. It will also serve to let the
          users know that she is accepting pattern testers and have a link to an
          external Google Form to apply for this. The Google Form has already
          been created and will only need to be linked to.
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Form Section</h3>
        <p>
          This section will serve as a means to make any sort of inquiries about
          products, services, or to learn more about becoming a pattern tester.
          The user will input their name, email address, and a brief message.
          The front end will pass this information to the backend, compose an
          email, and finally send that email directly to her.
